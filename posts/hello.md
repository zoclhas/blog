This seems fun doesn't it?!- Well anyways- HI! \
I am not at all good on writing about me(s) and introductions- so there be this _awful_ first blog.

\
Very well then-

### A bit of me

I am not gonna go by my real name for obvious reasons. _Here its stats then-_ I am Zoclhas, but you can call me Zoc/Zoch (or anything proper tbh). I am 16 years old. \
There are quite a few things I like:

-   Photography
-   Sunsets
-   Clouds
-   _Le_ moon
-   My PC / Laptop / Phone _(obviously)_
-   Minecraft
-   Programming
-   Creating Materials
-   Volleyball

(Gosh- There's prolly more but, I don't have enough braincells to thing think haha. I'm surprised I like this much stuff.)

\
Currently, I am doing web dev and creating materials for Minecraft and in general too. I also run a thing called [Zaura](https://zaura.net)- A site where I showcase the texturepacks I've created for Minecraft. Then there is obviously my own portfolio site- [zoclhas.com](https://zoclhas.com). (I may start a photography showcase site soon _smirks_). \
There is then my beautiful (not really) âœ¨[GitHub](https://github.com/zoclhas)âœ¨. You can find more links [here](https://zochy.xyz).

### Closing words

So I guess- that's all I've to say about me now. If you read this completely- THANK YOU!!! ^.^ \
I will hopefully write more blogs, and maybe make this open source in the future. \
Well.. have a great day ðŸ’œ!
