_Never thought I'd be writing so soon- but here I am :)_

&nbsp;

This is going to be a short blog, but a vital one too. I think I've refined this well enough for the repo to be public (hopefully). \
Now for the changes:

-   Finally added a favicon. It changes dynamically too depending on what theme you've chosen.
-   Replaced href with next router for going to the post pages. This should feel smoother when navigating.
-   Fixed SEO and meta tags in the home page.
-   Added a few plugins to markdown-it to make my life easier (yours too if you decide to the fork this :D).

### Now for the big news

I am finally making this open source!! _If it wasn't obvious from the title, image and the opening statement haha._ \
You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/zoclhas/blog){.ext}- There may be a few things that are out of place, but I am working on those and you can contribute too! And if I like it, I'll merge it with main. That's all I've got to say I think. AND I will still be working on the site and making blog posts every now and then, so no I'm not abandoning it :). \
Any thoughts or suggestions at all on this, you can contact me through the _multi_ ways I've listed on the [main site](https://zochy.xyz){.ext}. Or if you're lazy click [here for the mail](mailto:hi@zoclhas.com){.ext} or [here for the discord](https://discord.com/users/301347642682900481){.ext} or [here for the contact form](https://www.zoclhas.com/#contact){.ext}. \
**_If you decide to go through the repo's commit- be warned.._**

### Closing words

I've nothing more left to say- Till the next post- Take care and have a great day ðŸ’œ \
