## Before Forking:

Yes you can fork this repo, and modify it for your personal site- **but you attribution is required.**

You can give the attribution by linking my website [blog.zochy.xyz](https://blog.zochy.xyz/) or linking to this [GitHub Page](https://github.com/zoclhas/blog).

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

2. Install the dependencies

    ```sh
    npm i
    ```

3. Start the development server

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Start blogging!
    - Create a .md file in `./posts/`
    - Upload the images to `./public/images/`
    - *Disclaimer:* The library (markdown-it) doesn't support raw HTML, so there's that limitation. And all links inside each blog posts will open it in a new tab.

## Publishing the site

The best way I recommend is hosting it using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
